# Gemini Workspaces: Maintainer Onboarding

Gemini Workspaces allow you to offload heavy tasks (PR reviews, agentic fixes,
full builds) to a high-performance GCP worker. It uses a **Unified Data Disk**
architecture to ensure your work persists even if the VM is deleted or
recreated.

## 1. Local Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- **GCloud CLI**: Authenticated (`gcloud auth login`).
- **GitHub CLI**: Authenticated (`gh auth login`).
- **Project Access**: A GCP Project ID where you have `Editor` or
  `Compute Admin` roles.

## 2. Initialization

Run the setup script using the unified workspaces entry point:

```bash
npx tsx scripts/workspaces.ts setup
```

**What happens during setup:**

1.  **Auth Discovery**: It will detect your `GEMINI_API_KEY` (from `~/.env`) and
    `GH_TOKEN`.
2.  **Project Choice**: You will be prompted for your GCP Project and Zone.
3.  **Infrastructure Check**: It verifies if your worker
    (`gcli-workspace-<user>`) exists.
4.  **SSH Magic**: It generates a local `.gemini/workspaces/ssh_config` for
    seamless access.

## 3. Provisioning

If the setup informs you that the worker was not found, provision it:

```bash
npx tsx scripts/workspaces.ts fleet provision
```

_This creates a VM with a 10GB Boot Disk and a 200GB Data Disk. Initialization
takes ~1 minute._

## 4. Finalizing Remote Setup

Run the setup script one last time to clone the repo and sync credentials:

```bash
npx tsx scripts/workspaces.ts setup
```

_When you see "ALL SYSTEMS GO!", your workspace is ready._

## 5. Daily Usage

Once initialized, you can launch tasks directly through `npm` or the entry
point:

- **Review a PR**: `npm run workspace <PR_NUMBER> review`
- **Launch a Shell**: `npm run workspace:shell <ID>`
- **Check Status**: `npm run workspace:status`
- **Cleanup All**: `npm run workspace:clean-all`
- **Kill Task**: `npm run workspace:kill <PR> <action>`
- **Stop Worker**: `npx tsx scripts/workspaces.ts fleet stop` (Recommended when
  finished to save cost).

## Troubleshooting

- **Permission Denied (Docker)**: The orchestrator handles this by using
  `sudo docker` internally.
- **Dubious Ownership**: The system automatically adds `/mnt/disks/data/main` to
  Git's safe directory list.
- **Missing tsx**: Always prefer `npx tsx` when running scripts manually.
